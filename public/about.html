<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Marcelo Medina and i'm a Front end developer for about a year. I'm also a freelance Photographer.</p>

<p>I've depared myself trying to choose a website to show off my work and to obviously build a portfólio, but
  somehow none of the templates available were not everything i needed. Some were too simple and others too exagerated.
  So i thought: what if i could create my website/portfólio from scratch on my own? This was ultimately what drawn me
  into Front end developing.</p>
